For this exercise, I replaced most of the div tags in the index.html file with more descriptive semantic tags. I used several section, article and aside tags. I replaced one set of div tags with nav tags, and updated that section in the Style.css file accordingly. Please note that I had to zoom out the webpage to fit it all in the screenshot.
